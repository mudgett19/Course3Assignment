## Data Description

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 
we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments 
have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two 
sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in 
fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which 
has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration 
and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz 
cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time 
and frequency domain.


## Tidy data set description

The final data set contains 68 columns and 180 rows of data.  Each row contains the data collected for one person doing one
activity; the data include readings for 30 people each being tracked through six activities.  

Each row of the output tidydata.txt dataset has averaged variables for each subject and each activity.
Only all the variables estimated from mean and standard deviation in the tidy set were kept.

    mean(): Mean value
    std(): Standard deviation

The data were averaged for each combination of Activity and Data Point.

There are 6 Activities included in the data:

1.    WALKING
2.    WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3.    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4.    SITTING
5.    STANDING
6.    LAYING
